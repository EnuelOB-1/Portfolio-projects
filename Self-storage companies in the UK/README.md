# Project: Self-storage Companies in the UK
&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  


### Project Goals
Collect publicly available data from Companies House - GOV.UK on Self-storage companies in the UK.
&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  



### Details about  my contribution to the project
Entering the search query "self storage" at https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search returned a list of companies spanning 20pages. A close look at the search results on page 2 https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search?q=self+storage&page=2 and page 3 https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search?q=self+storage&page=3 revealed that:
* Each page contained the name of 20 Self-storage companies making 400 companies in all.
* The links to all 20pages of search results are identical with the exception of the page number at the end.
* Each company name is hyperlinked to respective company pages holding the data we needed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  



To get the data of interest (Company name, Name of the People, Address) for each of these 400 companies, I wrote a Python script to do the followings:
1. Crawl through all 20pages of search result scraping the links to each companyâ€™s page (i.e. 20links per page x 20pages)
2. Follow everyone of these 400links, crawling through each page and scraping company name, name of people and address for each Self-storage company.
3. Saving the final result as an Excel file.
